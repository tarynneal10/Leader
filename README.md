# Leader
Leader was created for FBLA's 2020 Mobile Application Development Event. It's purpose is chapter management, and it contains a variety of features to ease the burden of managing and organizing your local FBLA chapter.
You can join your local FBLA chapter, sign up if you're already a member, or add your chapter to keep your chapter connected. You can see your chapter's info, take your meeting minutes in the app, and your chapter members can all access the archives to see what was discussed if they missed a meeting! 
Leader keeps everyone updated with a current events page and calendar with descriptions of events. You can sign up for events to know what you plan on attending. You can view a variety of FBLA's competitive events and basic info about them, with links to them on the website for more info! You can add these events to Your Events, and delete them and submit them to your advisor as need be.

## Installation
Leader is fairly simple to install. It was made on Xcode 11, using swift 5, so make sure everything is up to date when you install. The master branch should have our most stable version that will be used for demonstration at FBLA state. Leader2 is for other changes made in the meantime, and is not the production version. 
If you want to see our code base just clone the respository and run pod install. To test, just sign up and add your chapter in the app once you get it running

SVProgressHUD was used to ease the users worries over Firebase’s slow load time, but belongs to its developer.
